# NOTE

## Organization

Organization can have a private store. Like `ibluebox`: https://www.raycast.com/ibluebox/say-no-to-notch

The `package.json` has the `owner` field, which is the organization name.

### Publish Extension Publicly

In `package.json`, if there's no `"access": "public"` specified, it will be published as a private extension.

To publish an extension publicly under an organization, you need to add `"access": "public"` to `package.json`.

## Publish Extension

Ensure the `package.json` has the required fields, such as `author`, `license`, `title`, `description`, and `icon`.

Ensure `"@raycast/api"` is the latest version.

Update `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the changes in the extension. See [Version History](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/prepare-an-extension-for-store#version-history).

Run `npm run build` to validate the extension.

Run `npm run publish` to publish the extension.

Running `npm run publish` will prompt you to log in to your GitHub account and allow the CLI tool to access your GitHub account.

For example, below is the output of running `npm run publish`:

```bash
‚ûú  say-no-to-notch git:(master) npm run publish

> publish
> npx @raycast/api@latest publish

üöÄ  Your extension has been submitted!

It will be reviewed by the Raycast team shortly.

You can see the submission here:
https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pull/14143

Be sure to add as much details as possible in the PR description to accelerate the review.
```

Under the hood, the `publish` does the following:

- Fork the [Raycast extensions repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions)
- Clone the forked repository
- Add the extension to the repository, under the `extensions` directory (e.g. `extensions/say-no-to-notch`)
- Push the extension to the repository
- Open a PR to the [Raycast extensions repository](https://github.com/raycast/extensions), e.g. https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pull/14143

The raw PR doesn't have all the necessary information, so you will need to edit the PR to add the missing information, for example:

- Clone the forked repository
  - `git clone git@github.com:honghaoz/raycast-extensions.git`
  - Add screenshots to `extensions/say-no-to-notch/metadata/say-no-to-notch-1`, `extensions/say-no-to-notch/metadata/say-no-to-notch-2` in the forked repository. 
    - See [Adding Screenshots](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/prepare-an-extension-for-store#adding-screenshots).
  - Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md in the forked repository.
- In PR:
  - Add description under the "Description" section.
  - Add screenshots under the "Screencast" section.

The PR will be reviewed by the Raycast team and once approved, the extension will be published.
